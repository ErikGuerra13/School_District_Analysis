# School_District_Analysis


# Overview of the school district analysis
- The purpose of this analysis is to assist the school district with analyzing standardized test data for reading and math for all the High Schools in the district. In addition to the test scores we will compare the results with the student funding for each school. By performing this analysis we will be able to provide the school distict with the information needed for decision making inregards to the school budgets and priorities. 

# Results
* How is the district summary affected? By removing the ninth grade reading and math tests we removed a total of 461 students from the district summary. In turn if you look at the pictures below you will see that the changes in the average scores and overall passing percentage changed very slightly. The overall passing percentage for the 15 total schools only went up by .1%.

This drop in overall percentage caused them to drop from 2nd place in our orignial analysis down to 8th.
